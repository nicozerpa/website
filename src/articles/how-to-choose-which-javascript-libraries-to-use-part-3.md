**Choosing the right tools is one of the most important decisions that you'll have to make when you start a new JavaScript project.**  In this four-article series, I'll give you my tips and tactics so you can choose the best libraries for your JS project.

## Documentation Is King

**If you choose a library that you've never used yet. You'll definitely need the documentation.** That's why the quality of the docs is a major factor when choosing libraries for your project.

The ideal documentation should be **easy to read and navigate.** You should be able to learn how the library works, when to use it, and when not to use it. If it includes comparisons with other similar libraries, even better.

But you should also be able to **look up a specific method or object quickly.** If you're already working with the library and you don't know how to do a specific task, the docs should let you find out how to use it.

The ideal docs should be up-to-date and they shouldn't be misleading. The problem is, you don't know if the docs are updated until it's too late. You'll notice it once you added it to your project and find out that it doesn't work as the docs said.

The solution to this? **Google what people say about the docs.** Whether they are good or bad, they'll post it online! Short comments like "The docs are great!" can be useful, but it's better if you can find more detailed opinions with the reasoning behind them.

An example of a detailed opinion: "The step by step tutorials are the main reason why the docs are great because it provides a way for the community to centralise its information."
