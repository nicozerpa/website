These two React hooks, `useMemo` and `useCallback` are useful when you’re dealing with expensive operations (that is, operations that are very complex and take a lot of time and resources, like CPU.)

If you include one of those expensive operations inside a React component, these costly tasks will run every time the component re-renders, making the application slower.

Those two hooks help to optimize the app by running the costly operation and storing the result in a cache. The next time the component re-renders, it won't run the operation. Instead, it will return the result from the cache.

## This is how useMemo works

Let's suppose that we have this expensive operation and a React component that uses it:
```javascript
function uselessExpensiveOperation(input) {
    const someBigArray = [];
    for (let i = 0; i < 5_000_000; i++) {
        someBigArray.push(input * i);
    }
    return someBigArray;
}

function SomeReactComponent() {
    const expensiveOperationResult = uselessExpensiveOperation(3);
    const output = expensiveOperationResult.slice(0, 5).map(number => <li key={ number }>{ number }</li>);

    return <ul>{ output }</ul>;
}
```
This example function can take many seconds to run. It returns an array of 5,000,000 numbers in which the value of each number depends of the number you pass as an argument. If you use `uselessExpensiveOperation` in a React component directly, every time React calls that component during the render process, it will run the expensive operation.

Now, this is what happens if you use the `useMemo` hook to store the value in cache:

```javascript
function SomeReactComponent() {
    const expensiveOperationResult = useMemo(
        function() {
            return uselessExpensiveOperation(3);
        },
        []
    );
    const output = expensiveOperationResult.slice(0, 5).map(number => <li key={ number }>{ number }</li>);

    return <ul>{ output }</ul>;
}
```
The first argument of `useMemo` is the function that contains the expensive operation, and the second argument is an array of dependencies. If the value of any of the dependencies change, React will delete the cache and will run the expensive task. 

The idea of the dependencies array is that you should include the variables that your expensive operation needs. In the example, the expensive operation doesn't have any dependency, so the array is empty.

## Don't overoptimize
A common mistake that some developers do is to use these hooks (and other optimization techniques) even when they're not needed, trying to prevent perfomance problems. But that's not recommended because it makes the code more complex (and therefore, harder to maintain) and in some cases it even performs worse.

You should apply these techniques after you find a perfomance problem. When something isn't running as fast as you would like, investigate where the bottleneck is and optimize that part.

explain memoization
useMemo: to store the result of an expensive operation
useCallback: memoizes a callback so that the function is the same always. dependencies for react.memo, dependencies for other hooks, etc
