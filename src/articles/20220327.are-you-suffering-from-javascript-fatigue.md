Let's face it, the JavaScript ecosystem can be overwhelming.

New libraries appear all the time, **there are dozens of libraries to do the same thing.** How many date pickers can there be? 10, 20, 50? Keeping up with all the changes seems almost impossible. That is JavaScript fatigue.

If you want to avoid JS fatigue, **remember that you don't have to learn everything.** I think it's enough just to be aware of the new tools, what their use cases are, and their pros/cons.

With that information, the next time you create a new project and you have to decide which stack to use, you'll have those libraries as available options.

**You can also focus on those tools that appear in job postings,** especially if your main focus is to get a job. For example, there are lots of job postings that require React. If you want to become more employable, learning that framework is a good idea.

Every now and then, it's not a bad idea to pick up a library that you find particularly interesting, even if it's just to create a toy project. That's what I recently did with Svelte, for example. 

JS fatigue can be a big problem, but you can prevent it from happening.
