Unfortunately, it's easy to feel overwhelmed and confused when you start learning JavaScript, or any programming language, for that matter. **The world of software is massive, there's just so many things to learn!**

Some of them think: "I'll never learn enough to be a good developer." Probably you are thinking the same too I have bad and good news about it, but **the good news outweigh the bad news**, thankfully.

On the one hand, you're right. There's lots and lots of things to learn. I've started learning my first language (JavaScript) when I was 13, as a hobby. Now, I'm 31 and I'm still learning about the language. And I'm sure I'll continue learning new things in the future.

On the other hand, **you don't need to know everything to be a good programmer.** I became a professional dev at 18 years old. At that time, I knew far less about JavaScript and other languages than I know now, but that didn't prevent me from get jobs and build amazing things in my career.

Think of programming languages as tools in your tool belt. **The more tools you have, the more things you can do.** But you already can do many things with the tools you already have.

And one of the keys to improve as a developer (and any skill) is just being persistent. If you keep learning and practising, you'll become a better programmer over time.
