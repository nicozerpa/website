"Learn the basics before you learn React", they say. But if you're a beginner who's learning with React first, you probably start to worry. You might start asking if you're learning everything the wrong way.

The thing is, **if you're learning React before the basics, chances are that you're doing it right.** And that's because it all boils down to your personal learning style.

Basically, **devs can learn things in two ways: bottom-up and top-down.** A bottom-up learner feels more comfortable learning the basics (i.e. JavaScript, HTML, or CSS) first. They only start learning the libraries after they feel confident with the fundamentals.

On the other hand, a top-down learner prefers learning the frameworks first. The framework patterns help them learn the fundamental libraries and languages under the hood.

## What's Your Learning Style?

And now, the question is: what's the best learning style for you? Of course, there's no one-size-fits-all answer, you'll have to find the answer for yourself.

**The best way to find out is to try both approaches, and check which method helped you learn better.** Or if you're already trying to learn things and you're facing too many challenges, try the opposite approach.

The only caveat here is: some top-down learners might put off learning the fundamentals, even after they became proficient with the framework. I strongly recommend that you **don't put off learning the fundamentals.**

Learning the basics helps you a lot when you have to find and fix bugs in your code. No matter if you learn them before or after, what counts is that you do know them.
